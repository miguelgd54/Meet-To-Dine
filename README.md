#Meet To Dine: Sponsor Winning Project at CALHACKS 4.0: UC Berkeley
We realized how difficult it can get sometimes to be able to plan meals with a bunch of friends, as there are always conflicting schedules and reservation issues that prevent from a well coordinated plan to occur. We wanted to solve this by being able to help groups of friends plan meals and make reservations using the OpenTable API.

The best solution was building a mobile app that helps groups solve this problem. It allows the user to plan a meal or join a meal where they have gotten an invite to. Then they are prompted to enter the times when they are free, and also the kind of cuisine they would like to eat. Our app then consolidates the times and suggests a restaurant list to help to choose from, based on reservation availability, preferences and reviews.

The majority of the front end was built using expo.io and react-native as it allowed us create robust mobile apps, and built the backend in express.js, which implemented a distant algorithm to select a restaurant that was within 10 miles of the current location of all members of the party, and then ranked the restaurants based on preferences and reviews.

We were able to develop parts of the GUI and workflow of the app, as well as majority of the backend algorithms that would be used to rank the restaurants for the user.
